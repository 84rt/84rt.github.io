*“In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn’t read all the time—none, zero. You’d be amazed at how much Warren [Buffett] reads—and how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I’m a book with a couple of legs sticking out.” - Charlie Munger*

This year, I managed to read more than one book per week, and I haven’t felt like I’m forgetting what I’ve read. This sparked a thought: how much reading would be too much? I’ve spent back-to-back days reading nonstop, and I haven’t hit that limit yet. But I noticed something unexpected: other sources of information—like social media or news—occupy the same mental space as knowledge from books. This got me thinking about the quality vs. quantity trade-off in reading.

## Quality over Quantity?

At first, I thought that to get the most out of my reading this year, I’d need to prioritize the most important books and avoid reading too many, as I feared I’d forget earlier material. But that’s not true. Not only do you remember more when you read more—since some books revisit topics from previous ones, reinforcing that knowledge—you also spend more time engaging with high-quality information.

Your brain has a process that, each night, transfers information from short-term to long-term memory, effectively deciding what to “save” or remember. It evaluates everything from your day and prioritizes the most important information. However, it’s rare to reach a point where your brain must discard valuable information to make room for even more, simply because you’ve consumed too much relevant data.

That said, this overload can happen if you spend all day studying, but most of us go to sleep with plenty of room for valuable information to be saved to “long-term storage” in our brains. If you’re currently reading only a few books a year, reading more would mean replacing other activities with reading. So, at the end of the day, when your brain decides what to save and what to discard, you’ll retain more of the important information. This means that we’re likely not reading enough on daily biases. 

I personally got most convinced to read more by the [area under the curve](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZCXjmeHNHYiM2uCw4/area-under-the-curve-eat-dirt-broccoli-errors-copernicus-and) argument.
