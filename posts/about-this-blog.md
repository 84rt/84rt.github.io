I am far from a good writer, so following the principle of learning through practice decided to bring to existence this blog. The posts here are unlikely to have any form of structure, regularity or reading value.

I do have to make a note that all posts here are and will be relatively low effort, and I do not intend to ensure that the information conveyed in them is original (or correct for that matter).

But now that you found yourself reading this meaningless post on my blog I can tell you what I think about life. I believe that most people spend a great majority of time (if not all of it) avoiding doing what they should be doing and distracting themselves with quite literally anything. They will perfectly rationalize why they are doing the thing that they are, but if you were to examine their actions closely you would find that there is a logical inconsistency in their actions. At this point, it is well known that humans are irrational by nature, but I don’t think people realize the magnitude to which this extends. From my personal experience, it seems to me that around 90% of new activities, or more, taken by all humans are indirectly and inefficiently attempting to achieve what they rationalize it to be meant to be achieving. This is likely because doing the most important thing in each given moment is highly stressful, so we hop from one distraction to another. If you don’t believe me, please explain to me how reading this dumb post is the most important thing that you could be doing right now.
