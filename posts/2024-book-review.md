In 2024, I read 62 books—roughly one per week. Some I started earlier, others I didn’t finish, but the count holds. This year’s reading spanned science non-fiction, fiction, personal growth, and classics, with biographies stealing the show. Here’s what I learned.

### Genre Breakdown
Science non-fiction led the pack, but fiction, personal growth, and classics weren’t far behind. The mix kept things fresh.

### Biographies
Biographies hooked me this year. They’re as gripping as fiction but hit harder with real-world insights. Standouts:

- Damn Right: A decent read on Charlie Munger’s life's story, it doesn't contian much wisdom like *Poor Charlie's Almanack* does but it's a good read..
- Lion in the White House: Theodore Roosevelt is a man who I admire greatly and this quickly became one of my favorite biographies.
- Benjamin Franklin: He was a true polymath and his life's story paints an amazing historical picture of the making of America as we know it.
- Steve Jobs: He's not a man you'd like if you met him, but he changed our lives profoundly through his acid induced visions.
- Shoe Dog: Phil Knight’s raw memoir on building Nike, it was more 'real' than I expected.
- Titan: The story of John D. Rockefeller’s is one everyone should know. He made me realizd that it's hard to defy habits learned in young age.
- A Long Walk to Freedom: Nelson Mandela is one of the most inspiring people I've heard of, and to see his story though his writing that survived prison is incredible. When people say it's a must read, they're right.

I found biographies to  build character and broaden perspectives like nothing else. They’re stories so they read really well, but they’re true which makes it a lot more fun.

### Classics
I dove deeper into classics this year. Key reads:

- 1984: Orwell’s dystopia hit hard.
- Anthem: Ayn Rand’s individualism, distilled.
- Letter to a Father: Kafka’s raw introspection.
- The Alchemist: Coelho’s simple, profound quest.

Classics always force me to think about why are they so popular. My current best idea as to why that is that these books are timeless in expressing human nature in various ways.

### Takeaway
I thought that reading 62 books in a year was a lot, but it didn’t overload me—it sharpened me. Biographies taught me grit and perspective; classics sparked big questions. Science non-fiction fueled curiosity, and personal growth books pushed me to act. Quality and quantity aren’t enemies—read more.
