Here is the complete list of all the books that I've read in 2024:

Interestingly, there seems to be quite a strong diversification in the genres of the books that I have read:

## The highlights

As there are more than 60 books on this list and even if I were to spare a minute per book, it would take more than an hour to get through the entire list. It is perhaps simpler for me, and more convenient for you, if I only mention the books that stood out the most from each of the genres:

### 1. General

While there are many books that I could talk about, one that stands out the most to me is "The Goal," which is highly unique in its content and form. It is essentially a manufacturing philosophy textbook that has been turned into a novel. Having read "The Toyota Way" before, I have come to see how beautifully explained the concept of lean manufacturing can be when put in the format of an engaging story. It made me think how much simpler education could be if more was taught through stories, and I wonder why this isn't done more often. I would highly recommend it to anybody interested in manufacturing, as well as those who don't want to have anything to do with it, since the lessons from lean manufacturing are transferable to almost anything one might want to do in life.

### 2. Philosophy

It is hard to review a philosophy work, so I am going to cheat a little bit by highlighting a book that I can't recommend enough called "The Practicing Stoic." It is the most pragmatic, coherent, readable, and well-explained accumulation of historic wisdom of the stoics I have yet encountered. It clarifies a lot of misconceptions people have about stoicism, especially when it comes to emotions, judgment, and discipline. On top of being somewhat comprehensive, it is also really easy to read. I would greatly recommend it to anybody who is well familiar with stoicism, but also to those who are completely new to it.

### 3. Biography

A biography that stood out to me this year is one about Theodore Roosevelt called "The Lion in the White House." I knew a fair bit about Theodore Roosevelt before, but this book has turned him from a person whom I had a good opinion of to a role model of mine. Though he was far from perfect, there are many lessons to be learned from a man of such virtue and volition.

### 4. Personal Growth

Personal growth is a category of books that I generally tend to avoid as much as I can. Every time I read a book that can be placed in the self-help/personal growth section of the library, I end up being mildly disappointed and somehow also a better person at the end of it. This year, I read two books about Ikigai, a concept that was unfamiliar to me before. This is a simple Japanese wisdom on how finding flow in simple crafts - which one enjoys, is good at, can be paid for, and are needed by others - is all that is needed for a good and satisfying life. It's such a simple and beautiful philosophy.

### 5. Classics

I'm not quite sure if these books are in fact classics or I just simply placed them in the category. Either way, the two books that I could talk about here are "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" and "Brave New World," both of which have significantly changed my worldview. But the book that I want to highlight is one that I completely didn't expect to read, as I bought it at the blind book sale at the Harvard bookstore. (They had this thing called "go on a blind date with a book" where you can buy a used book which is wrapped and there's only a description, not the title or any more detail. The description is usually quite enigmatic as well. I thought it's a really good gift idea, so I bought it for my girlfriend, unpacked it for her, and read it on her behalf as well) This book was "The Miracle Worker". It's about Helen Keller and her caretaker's struggle to communicate and function at the most basic level, as she lost her sight and hearing after a bout of illness when she was 19 months old. This is an extraordinary tale and a great read.

### 6. AI / Computer Science

A book that I have placed in this category is "Superintelligence," though perhaps it belongs in the philosophy section. The reason I put it here and not in philosophy is that while it might seem quite philosophical to read, many of the initial hypotheses drawn in the book have mostly come true in the following years. This book is absolutely instrumental and fundamental for anybody trying to form a foundation of understanding of what is the future of our civilization. It is a hard read, but it's damn worth it.

### 7. Fiction

It is surprising to me that it took me this long to finally read "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," but I did, and now that I have, I'm going to join the club of all of those annoying people who tell you to just read it and tell you that just go and read it already! Just think: what if you find yourself lost and hitchhiking in the Galaxy?

### 8. Entrepreneurship

A book that is becoming somewhat infamous in the circle of entrepreneurs is "The Mom Test." It's a very short and pragmatic book on how to get objective and unbiased answers out of people. I think this is a skill that is useful for anybody, but in this case, it's presented in the context of getting validation (or invalidation) on your idea for a company from potential customers. It is one of a few books I would keep close to me on my shelf for a long time.

## Was it too many?

Interestingly enough, I felt like it was just the right amount of books to read in a year. It isn't always possible to read this much, especially when your work requires you to read a lot. However, I am lucky to have been able to read this much this year.

 A life spent learning is a life spent well.

If I have learned anything from all of those books, it is that I know nothing and I should know a lot more.
